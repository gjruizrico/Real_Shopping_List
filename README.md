# real_shopping_list
Final project for a Java class at Boston University. The program asks the user for 7 shopping list items and does web scraping (using Selenium) on three of the major US stores to offer the top 3 results (total of 9) for each item. Below the IntelliJ project. See .java files (classes) for links and commentary too.
